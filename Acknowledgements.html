                    <p class="title">Super Painter Girl</p>
                    <p>This game was created using the Jelpi demo [2] created by Zep and available with the PICO8 [3] download. I simply cannot say enough good things about PICO8. I would strongly recommend anyone to download it and explore their creativity
                        with it. </p>

                    <p class="title">Cat Invaders</p>
                    <p>Cat Invaders: This was inspired by, and adapted from, Space-Shooter by Maxime Ney / baguette [4]. The cat sprites I found by simply googling ‘cat sprites,’ and the UFO sprite was from Swamp Odyssey by Paranoid Cactus [5]. Both these
                        games are awesome, so I’d encourage anyone reading this to check them out. </p>

                    <p class="title">Dance Dance Becky</p>
                    <p>This was a total ‘lift and shift’ from Pico8 Tunes Volume II by Gruber_Music, Castpixel and Krajzeg. [6]. Gruber has links to a donation page for his music, which I happily contributed to. I’m such a fan! The ‘Becky’ sprite on the
                        cover page was from the Friday Night Funkin demake by evman2k, which is the coolest demake I’ve ever seen. [7] Truly unbelievable! </p>

                    <p class="title">Crab People From Planet 48-B</p>
                    <p>I got the idea for this when by playing Aeroplane Adventure by hugeping. [8] I then looked at some more airplane games and found A Little Prince Song by czarlo [9], which I found to be extremely charming. The rest was a combination
                        of original work and recycling code and sprites from previous games already mentioned herein.</p>

                    <p class="title">Release the Becky</p>
                    <p>The idea for this game started with Matthew Klundt’s water wave tutorial on the PicoZine #2. [10] His closing line “I’d love to see what cool things you make with this code” encouraged me to play around with it. I just kept building
                        and playing until I ended up with this entire game. Thank you, Matthew!</p>

                    <p class="title">Super Painter Girl's Mars Landing</p>
                    <p>This game was one of the games included in the Game Development with PICO8 issue #1. [11] I’m not sure who specifically wrote this tutorial, but thank you to everyone who made this issue possible. I found it extremely helpful in learning
                        LUA and PICO8. </p>

                    <p>I’ve had a great time learning Lua and PICO8 and have explored a lot of people’s code on my journey. Ben Jones / powersaurus [12] has stood out to me as a particular source of inspiration. In particular, I thought his game Road Rex
                        was super cool and funny. </p>

                    <p>I take zero credit for this game. This is Yolwoocle's brilliant Pico Dino with a few differnt sprites and music. Please take a look a some of Yolwoocle's other works if you have time [13]. The simple description of 'a teenager passionate
                        about computers and making games' is so humble! @Yolwoocle - you are amazing. I'm so excited to see all that you will accomplish in your life and career! </p>
